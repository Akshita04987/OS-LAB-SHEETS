## OPERATING SYSTEMS LAB SHEETS
This repository contains the Operating Systems Lab Assignments (Lab Sheet 1 and 2) implemented in Python.
Each lab sheet focuses on different OS concepts such as process creation, synchronization, inter-process communication, and system simulation.

OBJECTIVE
To understand and implement the core Operating System concepts through Python programming — including process management, scheduling, communication, and synchronization.

-- LAB SHEET 1 – Process Management
This lab focuses on process creation, execution, and scheduling using the Python multiprocessing and os modules.

Tasks
Task	Title	Description
Task 1	Process Creation	Create multiple processes using the multiprocessing module.
Task 2	Command Execution	Execute system commands using os.execvp().
Task 3	Zombie & Orphan Processes	Simulate zombie and orphan process states.
Task 4	Process Information	Retrieve process info using psutil (PID, memory, CPU, etc.).
Task 5	Process Prioritization	Demonstrate process scheduling using nice() values.

-- LAB SHEET 2 – System Simulation and Synchronization
This lab demonstrates system startup, process logging, and inter-process coordination using Python’s multiprocessing and logging libraries.

Subtasks
Subtask 1	Logging Configuration	Configure logging for process tracking.
Subtask 2	System Process Function	Define a simulated system process.
Subtask 3	Concurrent Execution	Start multiple processes simultaneously.
Subtask 4	Termination and Shutdown	Wait for all processes to finish execution.
Final Code	Complete Program	Full system startup and shutdown simulation.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Python 3.x
2. VS Code
3. Ubuntu (WSL)
4. multiprocessing, os, psutil, logging modules

🧾 CONCLUSION

Both lab sheets successfully demonstrate practical OS concepts through Python programs.
From process creation and execution to logging and synchronization, each task builds a strong understanding of how an Operating System manages processes and resources.
